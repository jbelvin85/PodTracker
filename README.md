# PodTracker

A modern, containerized PWA for tracking Magic: The Gathering Commander games, decks, and stats.

---

## üìã Project Status

**Current Phase:** `Phase 1: Backend & Database Foundation`

The project is currently focused on building the core API, database schema, and user authentication systems. The foundational Docker environment and testing infrastructure are in place, but full test execution is pending the completion of Docker installation.

---

## ‚ú® Features

The goal of PodTracker is to provide a complete toolkit for Commander players:

- **Pod Management:** Create and manage your playgroups ("Pods").
- **Deck Lists:** Keep a list of your decks, including commander data and links to external deckbuilding sites.
- **Game Tracking:** Set up and track games, including registered and guest users (the players), turn order, life totals, commander damage, poison counters, energy counters, start time, end time and timestamped logs of all game actions (adding or removing counters, passing turns, players leaving the game, adding notes, and game resoltuion ie how the game was won) for more in-depth game review.
- **Match History:** Record and review your entire game history with a turn-by-turn event log.
- **Player Statistics:** Analyze your performance, deck win-rates, and more.
- **Chat:** Pod-based group chat and direct messaging between users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is fully containerized using Docker. Ensure you have **Docker Desktop** (or the Docker Engine/CLI) installed and running.

### 1. First-Time Setup (Run Once)

Clone the repository and run the setup script. This will check for prerequisites, install all Node.js dependencies, and create the necessary `.env` configuration files.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd podtracker
chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 2. Running the Application

Use ./scripts/deploy.sh to launch Docker Compose to build the images and start all the services.


The application services will be available at the following local addresses:

- **Frontend (React):** `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend (Express API):** `http://localhost:3001`

*Note: These ports are the defaults and can be configured in the root `.env` file after running the initialization script.*

### 3. Developer Workflow Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains helpers for common development tasks:

- **`./scripts/git-pr.sh [base-branch]`**: Prepares your current feature branch for a pull request. It fetches the latest changes, interactively rebases your branch onto the target branch (default: `main`), and force-pushes with a lease. This ensures a clean, linear history.
- **`./scripts/deploy.sh`**: A convenience script that runs `docker-compose up --build`.
- **`./scripts/get_timestamp.sh` / `.ps1`**: Returns a standardized timestamp string (`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`) for use in other scripts.

Make sure scripts are executable by running `chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh`.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Backend & Database Foundation** *(In Progress)*
  - [x] Establish Docker Environment & Services
  - [x] Define Initial Database Schema (`User`, `Deck`, `Pod`)
  - [x] Configure Isolated Test Environment (Test execution pending Docker installation)
  - [ ] Implement User Authentication (JWT)
  - [ ] Build Core CRUD APIs

- [ ] **Phase 2: Core Frontend Implementation**
  - [ ] Set up UI Framework, Routing, and Layout
  - [ ] Build Frontend Authentication Flow
  - [ ] Data Display: Build the primary views for displaying a user's decks and pods.
  - [ ] Data Management: Implement forms and components for creating and editing decks and pods, connecting them to the backend API via SWR.

- [ ] **Phase 3: The Gameplay Loop**
  - [ ] Game Setup: Develop the UI and backend logic for creating a new game from a pod of players and their chosen decks.
  - [ ] Live Game Tracking: Implement the interface for tracking life totals, commander damage, and other in-game events.
  - [ ] Game Conclusion: Finalize the logic for ending a game, determining a winner, and saving the results.

- [ ] **Phase 4: Expansion, Analytics & Polish**
  - [ ] Player Statistics: Create dashboards and views to analyze match history, deck performance, and win/loss rates.
  - [ ] PWA Features: Implement service workers for offline capabilities and add a web app manifest for "install to homescreen" functionality.
  - [ ] Social Features: Implement pod-based group chat and direct messaging.
  - [ ] UI Polish: Refine the user interface and experience based on user feedback.
  - [ ] Deployment: Prepare the application for a production environment.
