# Session Notes: 2025-08-19

**Objective:** Initialize the Wizard's records and begin backend construction.

**Status:** Backend foundation complete. Zod validation integrated. Prisma ORM setup in progress, with migration issue identified.

---

### Log

- **Baseline Established:** Reviewed Living Documents (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `THE_PRIMER.md`) to determine the primary task is the construction of the PodTracker application, starting with the backend API.

- **Backend Scaffolding:**
  - Created the core directory structure: `backend/src`, `backend/src/routes`, `backend/src/controllers`, and `backend/tests`.
  - Manually constructed `package.json` to avoid environment limitations.
  - Installed Node.js dependencies (`express`, `typescript`, `jest`, `supertest`, etc.) using the `npm --prefix` command.
  - Configured TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`) and Jest (`jest.config.js`).

- **API Structure Implementation:**
  - Created a health check endpoint (`/api/health`) to establish a baseline for API routing.
  - Implemented a controller (`healthController.ts`) and a route (`health.ts`) to separate concerns.
  - Integrated the new route into the main Express application (`index.ts`).

- **Testing and Debugging (Initial Backend Setup):**
  - Created an initial integration test for the `/api/health` endpoint.
  - **Encountered & Resolved Test Failure:** The initial test failed due to a TypeScript module resolution issue. 
  - **Solution:** Relocated the test file from `src/routes/` to a dedicated top-level `tests/` directory, which resolved the pathing issue and aligns with best practices.
  - Successfully executed the test suite, confirming the backend structure is sound.

- **Zod Validation Integration:**
  - Installed `zod` and `dotenv-cli` dependencies.
  - Created `backend/src/middleware/validate.ts` for generic Zod validation middleware.
  - Created `backend/src/schemas/spellSchema.ts` with a sample `createSpellSchema`.
  - Implemented `backend/src/controllers/spellController.ts` and `backend/src/routes/spell.ts` for a new `/api/spells` endpoint.
  - Integrated `spellRoutes` and `express.json()` middleware into `backend/src/index.ts`.
  - Created `backend/tests/spell.test.ts` for validation testing.
  - **Encountered & Resolved Zod Type Errors:**
    - Corrected `AnyZodObject` to `ZodObject` in `validate.ts`.
    - Corrected `required_error` and `invalid_type_error` syntax in `spellSchema.ts` to align with Zod's API.
  - Successfully executed all tests, confirming Zod validation is working as expected.

- **Prisma ORM Setup (In Progress):**
  - Installed `prisma` CLI and `@prisma/client`.
  - Created `backend/prisma` directory and `backend/.env` file.
  - Defined `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` with `User`, `Pod`, and `Deck` models.
  - Created `backend/src/lib/prisma.ts` for Prisma client singleton.
  - Generated Prisma client.
  - **Encountered `DATABASE_URL` Environment Variable Issue:** `npx prisma migrate dev` failed to find `DATABASE_URL` despite `.env` file presence.
  - **Solution:** Installed `dotenv-cli` and added a `prisma` script to `backend/package.json` to explicitly load the environment variables.
  - **Current Challenge:** `prisma migrate dev` (even with `--create-only`) appears to be interactive or takes too long in this non-interactive environment, causing it to seem stuck. This issue needs further investigation to find a truly non-interactive migration method or an alternative for applying schema changes in development (e.g., `db push`).

**Next Steps:**
- Update Living Documents (`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Prepare for commit and push to `dev` branch.
