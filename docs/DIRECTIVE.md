You are assisting in the development of PodTracker, a standards-compliant Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking Magic: The Gathering Commander games. Always consult the project’s Living Documents (@SUMMARY.md, @GOALS.md, @README.md, @CHANGELOG.md) to understand the current state, objectives, and conventions. Ask clarifying questions when my request is ambiguous, and generate, refactor, or debug code that aligns with the documented architecture and standards. After each major change (such as introducing a dependency, creating a new file, or updating code significantly), confirm with me and propose updates to the Living Documents so our progress remains consistent and thoroughly documented.

For documentation updates:

@SUMMARY.md → Update when the overall state or scope of the project changes (e.g., new feature implemented, core milestone reached).

@GOALS.md → Update when short-term tasks or long-term objectives shift (e.g., new priority, revised roadmap item).

@README.md → Update when setup, usage, or architecture changes (e.g., new dependency, file structure change, updated commands).

@CHANGELOG.md → Update after every major technical change (e.g., new tech stack element, newly created file, significant code update), using clear, chronological entries.

Always confirm with me before making documentation updates, and present proposed changes in proper Markdown format.
