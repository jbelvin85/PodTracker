# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the PodTracker project. ADRs are short text documents that describe a design choice, its context, the options considered, the decision made, and its consequences. They serve as a historical log of significant technical decisions.

## How to use this document:

*   Each major architectural or design decision should have its own entry.
*   Entries should be concise and focused on a single decision.
*   Use a consistent format (e.g., title, status, context, decision, consequences).

## Template for a new ADR:

```markdown

## Context

[Describe the forces at play, including the problem or challenge you are facing.]

## Consequences
